#Day-43 of #100DaysChallenge


Diving deep into something truly exciting today—a digital clock with a dark theme toggle. Here’s the rundown of my adventure:

✨ Clock Creation: Designed a sleek, dual-display clock combining both analog and digital elements. Every tick makes it feel alive!

✨ Dark Theme Toggle: Implemented a smooth, stylish toggle switch to flip between light and dark themes. coders doesn’t love a light mode😁

✨ JavaScript Magic: Used setInterval to keep our clocks ticking in real-time. It's so satisfying to see everything move seamlessly! 

✨ CSS Styling: Leveraged CSS to create modern, clean designs with beautiful transitions. The shadows add just the right depth!

It’s been an incredible journey, and I’m loving every second of it!
